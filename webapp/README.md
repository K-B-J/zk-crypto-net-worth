You can head over to [kryptoassetz.onrender.com](https://kryptoassetz.onrender.com) to try out the app in your browser.  

OR  

1. Create the env file using the env-sample file
2. Run the following command

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
cd frontend && yarn install
```

```bash
yarn start   # Will start the webapp (mostly used for deployment)
yarn client  # Will start only frontend
yarn server  # Will start only backend
yarn dev     # Will start the webapp for development
yarn build   # Will build frontend
```
